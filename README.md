# Musescore Downloader
Userscript for downloading high-quality scores and audio off Musescore for free. Download TamperMonkey [here](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), open the script, and copy paste its contents into the 'new script' tab in the TamperMonkey UI.

If you already have Musescore open in a tab, refresh it and the TamperMonkey extension should light up with a red '1' symbol. Look at the bottom right hand corner of your screen and the download buttons should be there.
